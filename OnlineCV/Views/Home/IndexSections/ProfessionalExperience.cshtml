                    I worked at Netcompany in Copenhagen as a software developer and consultant.
                    I worked mainly with .NET and SharePoint solutions creating SharePoint Applications, Web Applications, and Web Apis.
                    As part of a team we were working on many different solutions that each required critical and creative thinking to solve many different challenges.
